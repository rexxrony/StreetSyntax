### 1. User Registration and Login
- **Register**: A new user can register through the `/api/users/register` endpoint by providing a `username`, `email`, and `password`.
- **Password Encoding**: During registration, the password is securely encoded.
- **Default Role Assignment**: New users are assigned the default role of **USER**.
- **Login**: Users log in via `/api/users/login`. On successful login, a session attribute `AUTHENTICATED_USER` is set with the userâ€™s email to track their logged-in state.

### 2. User Session Management
- **Session Storage**: After a successful login, the user's session is stored on the server, enabling actions like viewing products and managing the shopping cart.
- **Logout**: A logout endpoint (`/api/users/logout`) is provided to securely end the session and clear cookies.

### 3. Product Management
- **Admin Control**: Admin users can manage product data through endpoints under `/api/product`. Available operations include:
  - **Add Product**: `/add` - Adds a new product.
  - **Delete Product**: `/delete/{prodId}` - Deletes a product by its ID.
  - **View Products**: Fetch all products or specific products by ID.

### 4. Shopping Cart Management
- **Add Items**: Authenticated users can add items to their cart using the `/api/cart` endpoint by specifying a `product ID` and `quantity`.
- **Session-Based Cart**: Cart items are specific to the user's session, ensuring each user has a personalized cart.
- **View and Remove Items**: Users can view all items in their cart or remove items using `/api/cart/remove/{cartItemId}`.
