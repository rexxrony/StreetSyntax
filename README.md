This project is an e-commerce backend system built with Spring Boot. It includes user management, product management, and a cart system where users can add or remove products. The project uses Spring Security to secure the endpoints based on roles, with ROLE_USER and ROLE_ADMIN distinguishing regular users and administrators. The system leverages BCrypt for password encryption, ensuring secure authentication. Additionally, it includes exception handling and logging to provide meaningful responses and track operations.
